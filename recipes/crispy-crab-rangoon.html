    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Everyone will love these bite-sized crab rangoon, fried to crispy perfection. Just place the crab filling onto
        square wonton wrappers, fold them into triangles, pull up the other edges to seal, and fry them until golden
        brown. To make these in advance, freeze them on trays, then fry them from frozen just before your party.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>2 (8 ounce)</strong> packages cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li><strong>1</strong> pound crabmeat, shredded</li>
        <li><strong>3</strong> tablespoons dark soy sauce</li>
        <li><strong>1</strong> teaspoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
        <li><strong>1/2</strong>teaspoon chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li><strong>1/2</strong> teaspoon dried parsley</li>
        <li><strong>1/2</strong> teaspoon minced garlic</li>
        <li><strong>1 (14 ounce)</strong> package small won ton wrappers</li>
        <li><strong>1</strong> quart oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix cream cheese, crabmeat, soy sauce, ginger, cilantro, parsley, and garlic together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large heavy skillet or deep fryer to 360 degrees F (180 degrees C).</li>
        <li>While the oil is heating, place 1/2 to 1 teaspoon cream cheese mixture into the center of a wonton wrapper.
            Moisten the wrapper edges and pull two corners together over filling to make a triangle. Pull two remaining
            corners up to join them, then press firmly to seal. Repeat to make remaining wontons. Place prepared wontons
            under a slightly moist paper towel until oil is hot.</li>
        <li>Working in batches, fry 3 or 4 wontons at a time in hot oil until golden brown and crispy, 1 to 2 minutes,
            flipping halfway through. Transfer wontons to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Serve hot.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Note</h2>
    <p>We have determined the nutritional value of oil for frying based on a retention value of 10% after cooking. The
        exact amount may vary depending on cook time and temperature, ingredient density, and the specific type of oil
        used.</p>
